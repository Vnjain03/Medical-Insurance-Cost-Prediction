# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Machine learning concepts used

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various individual factors. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate insurance costs with a high degree of accuracy, aiding both consumers and insurance providers in understanding the underlying factors that influence these costs.

The core focus of this project is to develop a regression model to predict insurance costs. The dataset used for training and testing contains multiple features that are known to impact insurance pricing, such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can make predictions based on unseen data.

Following libraries were used:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
